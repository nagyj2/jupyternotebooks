A noun phrase is either a proper name (`P`) or a determiner (`D`) followed by a noun (`N`). A verb phrase is either a verb (`V`) or a verb followed by a noun phrase. Determiners are `a` and `the`. The hierarchical composition of an English sentence by a *parse tree* is given to the right; below are the corresponding rules. Grammars of this form are called *generative* and the rules are called *productions*, as they determine how all sentences of a language are generated."

    "- If links exist to navigate between notebooks, place them at the top and provide a link to the main notebook content.\n",
    "- Use markdown structures for structure elements, not for style.\n",
    "- Use markdown style elements for style and not for structure (e.g. use `## Header`, not `*Header*`).\n",
    "- Use descriptive filenames and links where possible. \n",
    "- Put the purpose of a paragraph within the first sentence.\n",
    "- Avoid images of text.\n",
    "- Provide alt-text for bitmap images like photographs. Decorative images do not need alt-text.\n",
    "- Use mermaid diagrams for all other images.\n",
    "- End all lines in mermaid diagrams with a semicolon. This prevents screen readers from merging consecutive lines.\n",
    "- Avoid use of delimiters in text, such as quotes. Delimiters require the user to interact with their keyboard to continue reading the text through the screen reader. \n",
    "- Use syntax highlighting for visual appeal. Automatic colouring does not add information and is ignored by a screen reader.\n",
    "- Accompany significant uses of colour with text.\n",
    "- Prefer Unicode math symbols over $\\LaTeX$ symbols."
